  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#INTRO" id="INTRO">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document defines a notional information model for endpoint posture assessment. It describes the information needed to perform certain assessment activities. The scope of the information model is to describe the structure of the information carried to realize the assessment. It is meant to be a basis for the development of specific data models. The terms information model and data model loosely align with the definitions in RFC3444 <a href="#RFC3444">[RFC3444]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The four primary activities to support this information model are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Endpoint Identification</li>
  <li>Endpoint Characterization</li>
  <li>Endpoint Attribute Expression/Representation</li>
  <li>Policy evaluation expression and results reporting</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">These activities are aimed at the level of the technology that performs operations to support collection, evaluation, and reporting.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Review of the SACM Use Case <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases">[I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases]</a> usage scenarios show a common set of business process areas that are critical to understanding endpoint posture such that appropriate policies, security capabilities, and decisions can be developed and implemented.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">For this information model we have chosen to focus on the following business process areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Endpoint Management</li>
  <li>Software Management</li>
  <li>Configuration Management</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Management</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">These management process areas are a way to connect the SACM use cases and building blocks <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases">[I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases]</a> to the organizational needs such that the definition of information requirements has a clearly understood context. (/wandw). For more information, <a href="#mapping-to-sacm-use-cases">Appendix B</a> maps the SACM information model to the SACM use cases.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">The SACM information model offers a loose coupling between providers and consumers of security information. A provider can relay what it observes or infers, without knowing which consumers will use the information, or how they will use it.

<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Problem Statement</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">TODO: revise</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">(wandw)SACM requires a large and broad set of mission and business processes, and to make the most effective of use of technology, the same data must support multiple processes. The activities and processes described within this document tend to build off of each other to enable more complex characterization and assessment. In an effort to create an information model that serves a common set of management processes represented by the usage scenarios in the SACM Use Cases document, we have narrowed down the scope of this model.(/wandw) [What does "narrowed down the scope of this model" mean? - LL]</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">Administrators can't get technology from disparate sources to work together; they need information to make decisions, but the information is not available. Everyone is collecting the same data, but storing it as different information. Administrators therefore need to collect data and craft their own information, which may not be accurate or interoperable because it's customized by each administrator, not shared. A standard information model enables flexibility in collecting, storing, and sharing information despite platform differences.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">A way is needed to exchange information that (a) has breadth, meaning the pieces of the notation are useful about a variety of endpoints and software components, and (b) has longevity, meaning that the pieces of the notation will stay useful over time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">When creating standards, it's not sufficient to go from requirements directly to protocol; the standards must eliminate ambiguity in the information transported. This is the purpose of information models generally. The SACM problem space is about integrating many information sources. This information model addresses the need to integrate security components, support multiple data models, and provide interoperability in a way that is platform agnostic, scales, and works over time.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.1">1.1.1.</a> <a href="#section-referring-to-an-endpoint" id="section-referring-to-an-endpoint">Referring to an Endpoint</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.1">How to refer to an endpoint is problematic. Ideally, an endpoint would have a unique identifier. These identifiers would have a one-to-one relationship with endpoints. Every observation of an endpoint, or inference about an endpoint would be labeled with its identifier. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.2">However: </p>

<ul>
  <li>An external posture attribute collector typically cannot observe the unique identifier directly. An external posture attribute collector should be able to report exactly what it has observed, unembellished. It should not have to *infer* which endpoint it has observed; that inference should be leavable to other SACM components. So, SACM cannot require that every observation include the unique endpoint identifier.</li>
  <li>Internal posture attribute collectors are not present on all endpoints. They are not present on "dumb" devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, or on Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) devices. In these cases, *no* observers have direct access to the unique endpoint identifier.</li>
  <li>An endpoint identifier is generally subject to cloning, when a system image is cloned. Then it is no longer unique.</li>
  <li>Suppose the endpoint identifier is highly clone resistant -- such a unique certificate within a trusted platform module TPM.  Even so, it is possible to replace all of the software -- for example, changing a Windows machine to a Linux machine.  Is it still the same endpoint? For SACM purposes, it isn't really the same endpoint. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.1.p.3">So SACM components must be able to put disparate observations together and form a picture of an endpoint -- somewhat like a detective. The SACM information model must facilitate this.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1.2">1.1.2.</a> Dealing with Uncertainty</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.1">With many information models, the information is considered certain.  In SACM, information is not certain.  Attackers may develop countermeasures to fool some SACM components.  Attackers may compromise some SACM components.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.2">So the model must let SACM components and humans reason with uncertainty. There are no facts, only assertions. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.3">SACM components must be able to cross check observations and inferences against each other. They should be able to give weight if an observation or inference is corroborated by more than one method. Although SACM will probably not prescribe *how* to do this cross checking, SACM should provide the components with provenance information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.2.p.4">SACM components must be able to consider the reputation of the observer or inferrer. That reputation should account for the method  of observing or inferring, the implementer of the SACM component that made the observation or inference, and the compliance status of the endpoint on which the observation or inference was made.  For example, if some observers are found to be vulnerable to a Day 1 exploit, observations from those observers deserve less weight. The details of reputation technology may be out of scope for SACM. However, again, SACM should provide components with provenance information.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The SACM information model is structured around a core framework that can be easily extended to support the modeling needs for endpoint posture assessment. This section describes the key concepts that make up this framework as well as the conventions used to model the different information model objects in the following sections.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> Containers</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">TODO: Explain containers at a conceptual level and how they are the mechanism by which attributes and/or other containers can be logically grouped together to create more complex models. Additional information about containers can be modeled using metadata. QUESTION: We are not sure "container" is the correct term to use here as it implies a hierarchy. Alternative terms might be "construct", "object", or "class". This is something that needs to be decided.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> Attributes</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">TODO: Explain attributes at a conceptual level and how they are used to model posture attribute information on an endpoint. At a minimum, an attribute must have a name and a value.  However, there is work currently being done in the Endpoint ID Design Team to prepare a proposal for the working group to explain how triples (subject, predicate, object) could be used to model attributes in the information model. Additional information about attributes can be modeled using metadata.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> Metadata</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">TODO: Explain metadata at a conceptual level and how it can be used to provide additional information about containers and attributes. We should be providing enough information so that SACM users can determine provenance (e.g. source of origin, time of collection, observation, reporting, etc.) and use it when sharing and evaluating posture attribute information.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> Relationships</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">TODO: Define what a relationship is.  At the end of the day, we want to be able to describe the relationships between assets, endpoints, and attributes.  QUESTION: Are relationships just metadata? Lisa's notes have some information on relationships: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/sacm/kWxlnboHAXD87cned9WavwPZy5w</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.5"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5">3.5.</a> Designation</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1">TODO: In the IETF, there are privacy concerns with respect to endpoint identity and monitoring. As a result, the Endpoint ID Design Team proposes that "endpoint identity" be changed to "endpoint designation". Designation attributes can be used to correlate endpoints, information about endpoints, events, etc. NOTE: Designation attributes are just those that are mandatory-to-implement. In practice, organizations may need to select additional attributes beyond the mandatory-to-implement attributes to successfully identify an endpoint on their network.  Operational and privacy concerns will be covered in Operational Considerations and Privacy Considerations sections respectively.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.6"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6">3.6.</a> Conventions for Modeling Information Model Objects</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1">TODO: The working group needs to select the conventions that will be used to model the different objects defined in the information model.  Members of the Endpoint ID Design Team are looking into different examples of how other working groups have modeled the objects in their information models so that the working can select one that makes the most sense for SACM.  Once conventions have been selected, they should be documented here for future reference.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#information-model-assets" id="information-model-assets">Information Model Assets</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">TODO: Explain the different SACM assets. Right now, we have distilled this down to an endpoint, hardware, software, and identity. Previously, this diagram also included account, location, address, and network inteface, but, these things are not assets and can either be consolidated into one of the existing asset types (e.g. network interface =&gt; hardware, account =&gt; identity, etc.) or are just metadata about the assets (e.g. location =&gt; endpoint). We should also explain the types of assets below rather than just referencing out to the Terminology draft.  </p>

  <li>"Authority" means that the provider got the information, directly or indirectly, from an authority that assigned it.  For example, the producer got an IP-MAC association from a DHCP server (or was itself the DHCP server).</li>
  <li>"Observation" means that the provider got the information from observations of network traffic.  For example, the producer saw the source address in an IP packet.</li>
  <li>"Verification" means that the provider has verified the information.

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.3.1.p.6">(Cliff): Scope strings are like administrative-domain in IF-MAP.  It would solve many problems if DHCP servers could provide this string to endpoints and to observers.  I am not sure whether there is a standard DHCP option that fills the bill or not.  I am not sure how easily application software can get the DHCP options from the underlying OS.  But this is worth exploring.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.3.1.p.7">(Jim): We may need to look at what happens if a scope identifier is either not set or not available.  I am thinking of the virtual network that is NATed on my machine.  If those VMs reported [on themselves] then the network configuring systems may not know about that VM and there would not necessarily be a reasonable scope string to report for it.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.1.p.2">In this example, the components are instantiated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Posture Attribute Information Provider is an endpoint security service which monitors the compliance state of the endpoint and reports any deviations for the expected posture.</li>
  <li>The Posture Attribute Information Consumer is an analytics engine which absorbs information from around the network and generates a "heat map" of which areas in the network are seeing unusually high rates of posture deviations.</li>
  <li>The Control Plane is a security automation broker which receives subscription requests from the analytics engine and authorizes access to appropriate information from the endpoint security service.</li>

  <li>Location metadata attached to a link between a network session identifier and an address identifier.</li>
  <li>Event metadata attached to an address identifier or an identity identifier of an endpoint, which would be made available to interested parties at the time of publication, but not stored long-term. For example, when a user disables required security software, an internal collector associated with an endpoint security service might publish guidance violation event metadata attached to the identity identifier of the endpoint, to notify consumers of the change in endpoint state.</li>
  <li>Posture attribute metadata attached to an identity identifier of an endpoint.

<p id="rfc.section.6.1.4.p.1">Interaction between multiple sets of identifiers and metadata lead to some fairly common patterns, or "constellations", of metadata. For example, an authenticated-session metadata constellation might include a central network session with authorizations and location attached, and links to a user identity, an endpoint identity, a MAC address, an IP address, and the identity of the policy server that authorized the session, for the duration of the network session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.4.p.2">These constellations may be independent of each other, or one constellation may be connected to another. For example, an authenticated-session metadata constellation may be created when a user connects an endpoint to the network; separately, an endpoint- posture metadata constellation may be created when an endpoint security system and other collectors gather and publish posture information related to an endpoint. These two constellations are not necessarily connected to each other, but may be joined if the component publishing the authenticated-session metadata constellation is able to link the network session identifier to the identity identifier of the endpoint.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.2"><a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> Workflow</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">The workflow for exchange of information supporting detection of posture deviation, using a standard publish/subscribe/query transport model such as available with IF-MAP <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding">[TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding]</a> or XMPP-Grid <a href="#I-D.salowey-sacm-xmpp-grid">[I-D.salowey-sacm-xmpp-grid]</a>, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The analytics engine (Posture Assessment Information Consumer) establishes connectivity and authorization with the transport fabric, and subscribes to updates on posture deviations.</li>
  <li>The endpoint security service (Posture Assessment Information Provider) requests connection to the transport fabric.</li>
  <li>Transport fabric authenticates and establishes authorized privileges (e.g. privilege to publish and/or subscribe to security data) for the requesting components.</li>
  <li>The endpoint security service evaluates the endpoint, detects posture deviation, and publishes information on the posture deviation.</li>
  <li>The transport fabric notifies the analytics engine, based on its subscription of the new posture deviation information.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">Other components, such as access control policy servers or remediation systems, may also consume the posture deviation information provided by the endpoint security service.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">Posture Assessments need to be performed in a safe and secure manner. In that regard, there are multiple aspects of security that apply to the communications between components as well as the capabilities themselves. Due to time constraints, this information model only contains an initial listing of items that need to be considered with respect to security. This list is not exhaustive, and will need to be augmented as the model continues to be developed/refined.</p>

  <dt>Authentication:</dt>

  <dt>Confidentiality:</dt>

<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.1">Renamed "credential" to "identity", following industry usage. A credential includes proof, such as a key or password. A username or a distinguished name is called an "identity".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.2">Removed Session, because an endpoint's network activity is not SACM's initial focus</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.3">Removed Authorization, for the same reason</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.4">Added many-to-many relationship between Hardware Component and Endpoint, for clarity</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.5">Added many-to-many relationship between Software Component and Endpoint, for clarity</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.6">Added "contains" relationship between Network Interface and Network Interface</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.7">Removed relationship between Network Interface and Account. The endpoint knows the identity it used to gain network access. The PDP also knows that. But they probably do not know the account.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.8">Added relationship between Network Interface and Identity. The endpoint and the PDP will typically know the identity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.9">Made identity-to-account a many-to-one relationship.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.B.p.3">Sections [removed] thru [removed] address each of the process areas. For each process area, a "Process Area Description" sub-section represent an end state that is consistent with all the General Requirements and many of the Use Case Requirements identified in the requirements draft <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements">[I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements]</a>.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.C"><a href="#rfc.appendix.C">Appendix C.</a> Security Automation with TNC IF-MAP</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.C.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.C.1">C.1.</a> What is Trusted Network Connect?</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.1">Trusted Network Connect (TNC) is a vendor-neutral open architecture <a href="#TNC-Architecture">[TNC-Architecture]</a> and a set of open standards for network security developed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). TNC standards integrate security components across end user systems, servers, and network infrastructure devices into an intelligent, responsive, coordinated defense. TNC standards have been widely adopted by vendors and customers; the TNC endpoint assessment protocols <a href="#TNC-IF-M-TLV-Binding">[TNC-IF-M-TLV-Binding]</a><a href="#TNC-IF-TNCCS-TLV-Binding">[TNC-IF-TNCCS-TLV-Binding]</a><a href="#TNC-IF-T-Tunneled-EAP">[TNC-IF-T-Tunneled-EAP]</a><a href="#TNC-IF-T-TLS">[TNC-IF-T-TLS]</a> were used as the base for the IETF NEA RFCs <a href="#RFC5792">[RFC5792]</a><a href="#RFC5793">[RFC5793]</a><a href="#RFC7171">[RFC7171]</a><a href="#RFC6876">[RFC6876]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.2">Traditional information security architectures have separate silos for endpoint security, network security, server security, physical security, etc. The TNC architecture enables the integration and categorization of security telemetry sources via the information model contained in its Interface for Metadata Access Points (IF-MAP) <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding">[TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding]</a>. IF-MAP provides a query-able repository of security telemetry that may be used for storage or retrieval of such data by multiple types of security systems and endpoints on a vendor-neutral basis. The information model underlying the IF-MAP repository covers, directly or indirectly, all of the security information types required to serve SACM use-cases.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.C.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.C.2">C.2.</a> What is TNC IF-MAP?</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.1">IF-MAP provides a standard client-server protocol for MAP clients to exchange security-relevant information via database server known as the Metadata Access Point or MAP. The data (known as "metadata") stored in the MAP is XML data. Each piece of metadata is tagged with a metadata type that indicates the meaning of the metadata and identifies an XML schema for it. Due to the XML language, the set of metadata types is easily extensible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.2">The MAP is a graph database, not a relational database. Metadata can be associated with an identifier (e.g. the email address "user@example.com") or with a link between two identifiers (e.g. the link between MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55 and IPv4 address 192.0.2.1) where the link defines an association (for example: a relation or state) between the identifiers. These links between pairs of identifiers create an ad hoc graph of relationships between identifiers. The emergent structure of this graph reflects a continuously evolving knowledge base of security-related metadata that is shared between various providers and consumers.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.C.3"><a href="#rfc.appendix.C.3">C.3.</a> What is the TNC Information Model?</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.1">The TNC Information Model underlying IF-MAP relies on the graph database architecture to enable a (potentially distributed) MAP service to act as a shared clearinghouse for information that infrastructure devices can act upon.  The IF-MAP operations and metadata schema specifications (TNC IF-MAP Binding for SOAP <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding">[TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding]</a>, TNC IF-MAP Metadata for Network Security <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA]</a>, and TNC IF-MAP Metadata for ICS Security <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA]</a>) define an extensible set of identifiers and data types.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.2">Each IF-MAP client may interact with the IF-MAP graph data store through three fundamental types of operation requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publish, which may create, modify, or delete metadata associated with one or more identifiers and/or links in the graph</li>
  <li>Search, which retrieves a selected sub-graph according to a set of search criteria</li>
  <li>Subscribe, which allows a client to manage a set of search commands which asynchronously return selected sub-graphs when changes to that sub-graph are made by other IF-MAP clients</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.3">The reader is invited to review the existing IF-MAP specification <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding">[TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding]</a> for more details on the above graph data store operation requests and their associated arguments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.4">The current IF-MAP specification provides a SOAP <a href="#W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427">[W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427]</a> binding for the above operations, as well as associated SOAP operations for managing sessions, error handling, etc.</p>

  <dt>Asset</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">For this Information Model it is necessary to change the scope of the definition of asset from the one provided in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology">[I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]</a>. Originally defined in <a href="#RFC4949">[RFC4949]</a> and referenced in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology">[I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]</a> as "a system resource that is (a) required to be protected by an information system's security policy, (b) intended to be protected by a countermeasure, or (c) required for a system's mission." This definition generally relates to an "IT Asset", which in the context of this document is overly limiting. For use in this document, a broader definition of the term is needed to represent non-IT asset types as well.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">In <a href="#NISTIR-7693">[NISTIR-7693]</a> an asset is defined as "anything that has value to an organization, including, but not limited to, another organization, person, computing device, information technology (IT) system, IT network, IT circuit, software (both an installed instance and a physical instance), virtual computing platform (common in cloud and virtualized computing), and related hardware (e.g., locks, cabinets, keyboards)."

The use of "protocol" in its name is a misnomer, as SCAP defines only data models. SCAP has been adopted by a number of operating system and security tool vendors.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E"><a href="#rfc.appendix.E">Appendix E.</a> Text for Possible Inclusion in the Architecture or Use Cases</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.E.1">E.1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.1">The posture of an endpoint is the status of the endpoint with respect to the security policies and risk models of the organization.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.2">A system administrator needs to be able to determine which elements of an endpoint have a security problem and which do not conform the organization's security policies. The CIO needs to be able to determine whether endpoints have security postures that conform to the organization's policies to ensure that the organization is complying with its fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities. The regulator or auditor needs to be able to assess the level of due diligence being achieved by an organization to ensure that all regulations and due diligence expectations are being met. The operator needs to understand which assets have deviated from organizational policies so that those assets can be remedied.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.3">Operators will focus on which endpoints are composed of specific assets with problems. CIO and auditors need a characterization of how an organization is performing as a whole to manage the posture of its endpoints. All of these actors need deployed capabilities that implement security automation standards in the form of data formats, interfaces, and protocols to be able to assess, in a timely and secure fashion, all assets on all endpoints within their enterprise. This information model provides a basis to identify the desirable characteristics of data models to support these scenarios. Other SACM specifications, such as the SACM Architecture, will describe the potential components of an interoperable system solution based on the SACM information model to address the requirements for scalability, timeliness, and security.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.E.2">E.2.</a> Core Principles</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.1">This information model is built on the following core principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collection and Evaluation are separate tasks.</li>
  <li>Collection and Evaluation can be performed on the endpoint, at a local server that communicates directly with the endpoint, or based on data queried from a back end data store that does not communicate directly with any endpoints.</li>
  <li>Every entity (human or machine) that notifies, queries, or responds to any guidance, collection, or evaluator must have a way of identifying itself and/or presenting credentials. Authentication is a key step in all of the processes, and while needed to support the business processes, information needs to support authentication are not highlighted in this information model. There is already a large amount of existing work that defines information needs for authentication.</li>
  <li>Policies are reflected in guidance for collection, evaluation, and reporting.</li>
  <li>Guidance will often be generated by humans or through the use of transformations on existing automation data. In some cases, guidance will be generated dynamically based on shared information or current operational needs. As guidance is created it will be published to an appropriate guidance data store allowing guidance to be managed in and retrieved from convenient locations.</li>
  <li>Operators of a continuous monitoring or security automation system will need to make decisions when defining policies about what guidance to use or reference. The guidance used may be directly associated with policy or may be queried dynamically based on associated metadata.</li>
  <li>Guidance can be gathered from multiple data stores. It may be retrieved at the point of use or may be packaged and forwarded for later use.  Guidance may be retrieved in event of a collection or evaluation trigger or it may be gathered ahead of time and stored locally for use/reference during collection and evaluation activities.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E.3"><a href="#rfc.appendix.E.3">E.3.</a> Architecture Assumptions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.1">This information model will focus on WHAT information needs to be exchanged to support the business process areas. The architecture document is the best place to represent the HOW and the WHERE this information is used. In an effort to ensure that the data models derived from this information model scale to the architecture, four core architectural components need to be defined. They are producers, consumers, capabilities, and repositories. These elements are defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Producers (e.g., Evaluation Producer) collect, aggregate, and/or derive information items and provide them to consumers. For this model there are Collection, Evaluation, and Results Producers. There may or may not be Guidance Producers.</li>
  <li>Consumers (e.g., Collection Consumer) request and/or receive information items from producers for their own use. For this model there are Collection, Evaluation, and Results Consumers. There may or may not be Guidance Consumers.</li>
  <li>Capabilities (e.g., Posture Evaluation Capability) take the input from one or more producers and perform some function on or with that information. For this model there are Collection Guidance, Collection, Evaluation Guidance, Evaluation, Reporting Guidance, and Results Reporting Capabilities.</li>
  <li>Repositories (e.g., Enterprise Repository) store information items that are input to or output from Capabilities, Producers, and Consumers. For this model we refer to generic Enterprise and Guidance Repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.2">Information that needs to be communicated by or made available to any of these components will be specified in each of the business process areas.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.3">In the most trivial example, illustrated in <a href="#figure-producer-consumer">Figure 5</a>, Consumers either request information from, or are notified by, Producers.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 7: Producer/Consumer Complex Example</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.7">This illustrative example in <a href="#figure-producer-consumer-complex-example">Figure 7</a> provides a set of information exchanges that need to occur to perform a posture assessment. The rest of this information model is using this set of exchanges based on these core architectural components as the basis for determining information elements.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.F"><a href="#rfc.appendix.F">Appendix F.</a> Text for Possible Inclusion in the Requirements Draft</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.F.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.F.1">F.1.</a> Problem Statement</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.F.1.p.1">Scalable and sustainable collection, expression, and evaluation of endpoint information is foundational to SACM's objectives. To secure and defend one's network one must reliably determine what devices are on the network, how those devices are configured from a hardware perspective, what software products are installed on those devices, and how those products are configured. We need to be able to determine, share, and use this information in a secure, timely, consistent, and automated manner to perform endpoint posture assessments.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.F.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.F.2">F.2.</a> Problem Scope</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.F.2.p.1">The goal of this iteration of the information model is to define the information needs for an organization to effectively monitor the endpoints operating on their network, the software installed on those endpoints, and the configuration of that software. Once we have those three business processes in place, we can identify vulnerable endpoints in a very efficient manner.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.F.2.p.2">The four business process areas represent a large set of tasks that support endpoint posture assessment. In an effort to address the most basic and foundational needs, we have also narrowed down the scope inside of each of the business processes to a set of defined tasks that strive to achieve specific results in the operational environment and the organization. These tasks are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the assets. This is what we want to know about an asset. For instance, organizations will want to know what software is installed and its many critical security attributes such as patch level.</li>
  <li>Resolve what assets compose an endpoint. This requires populating the data elements and attributes needed to exchange information pertaining to the assets composing an endpoint.</li>
  <li>Express what expected values for the data elements and attributes need to be evaluated against the actual collected instances of asset data. This is how an organization can express its policy for an acceptable data element or attribute value. A system administrator can also identify specific data elements and attributes that represent problems, such as vulnerabilities, that need to be detected on an endpoint.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the collected instances of the asset data against those expressed in the policy.</li>
  <li>Report the results of the evaluation.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G">Appendix G.</a> Text With No Clear Home Yet</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G.1">G.1.</a> Operations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.1.p.1">Operations that may be carried out the proposed SACM Information Model are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publish data: Security information is made available in the information model when a component publishes data to it.</li>
  <li>Subscribe to data: A component seeking to consume an on-going stream of security information "subscribes" to such data from the information model.</li>
  <li>Query: This operation enables a component to request a specific set of security data regarding a specific asset (such as a specific user endpoint).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.G.1.p.2">The subscribe capability will allow SACM components to monitor for selected security-related changes in the graph data store without incurring the performance penalties associated with polling for such changes.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G.1.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G.1.1">G.1.1.</a> Generalized Workflow</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.1.1.p.1">The proposed SACM Information Model would be most commonly used with a suitable transport protocol for collecting and distributing security data across appropriate network platforms and endpoints. The information model is transport agnostic and can be used with its native transport provided by IF-MAP or by other data transport protocols such as the recently proposed XMPP-Grid.</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>A Posture Assessment Information Consumer (Consumer) establishes connectivity and authorization with the transport fabric.</li>
  <li>A Posture Assessment Information Provider (Provider) with a source of security data requests connection to the transport fabric.</li>
  <li>Transport fabric authenticates and establishes authorized privileges (e.g. privilege to publish and/or subscribe to security data) for the requesting components.</li>
  <li>Components may either publish security data, subscribe to security data, query for security data, or any combination of these operations.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.G.1.1.p.3">Any component sharing information - either as Provider or Consumer - may do so on a one-to-one, one-to-many and/or many-to-many meshed basis.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G.2">G.2.</a> From Information Needs to Information Elements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.2.p.1">The previous sections highlighted information needs for a set of management process areas that use posture assessment to achieve organizational security goals. A single information need may be made up of multiple information elements. Some information elements may be required for two different process areas, resulting in two different requirements. In an effort to support the main idea of collect once and reuse the data to support multiple processes, we try to define a singular set of information elements that will support all the associated information needs.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G.3"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G.3">G.3.</a> <a href="#im-elements" id="im-elements">Information Model Elements</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.1">TODO: Kim to pull up relevant content into section 4 / Elements</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.2">Traditionally, one would use the SACM architecture to define interfaces that required information exchanges. Identified information elements would then be based on those exchanges. Because the SACM architecture document is still in the personal draft stage, this information model uses a different approach to the identification of information elements. First it lists the four main endpoint posture assessment activities. Then it identifies management process areas that use endpoint posture assessment to achieve organizational security objectives. These process areas were then broken down into operations that mirrored the typical workflow from the SACM Use Cases draft <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases">[I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases]</a>. These operations identify architectural components and their information needs. In this section, information elements derived from those information needs are mapped back to the four main activities listed above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.3">The original liaison statement <a href="#IM-LIAISON-STATEMENT-NIST">[IM-LIAISON-STATEMENT-NIST]</a> requested contributions for the SACM information model in the four areas described below.  Based on the capabilities defined previously in this document, the requested areas alone do not provide a sufficient enough categorization of the necessary information model elements. The following sub-sections directly address the requested areas as follows:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.4">Additionally, <a href="#IM-ELEMENTS-OTHER-IDENTIFIERS">Appendix G.3.2</a> <a href="#IM-ELEMENTS-OTHER-IDENTIFIERS">Other Identifiers</a>: describes other important identification concepts that were not directly requested by the liaison statement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.5">Per the liaison statement, each subsection references related work that provides a basis for potential data models. Some analysis is also included for each area of related work on how directly applicable the work is to the SACM efforts. In general, much of the related work does not fully address the general or use case-based requirements for SACM, but they do contain some parts that can be used as the basis for data models that correspond to the information model elements. In these cases additional work will be required by the WG to adapt the specification. In some cases, existing work can largely be used in an unmodified fashion. This is also indicated in the analysis. Due to time constraints, the work in this section is very biased to previous work supported by the authors and does not reflect a comprehensive listing. An attempt has been made where possible to reference existing IETF work. Additional research and discussion is needed to include other related work in standards and technology communities that could and should be listed here.  The authors intend to continue this work in subsequent revisions of this draft.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.p.6">Where possible when selecting and developing data models in support of these information model elements, extension points and IANA registries SHOULD be used to provide for extensibility which will allow for future data models to be addressed.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.p.1">In this context an "asset" refers to "anything that has value to an organization" (see <a href="#NISTIR-7693">[NISTIR-7693]</a>). This use of the term "asset" is broader than the current definition in <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology">[I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]</a>. To support SACM use cases, a number of different asset types will need to be addressed. For each type of asset, one or more type of asset identifier will be needed for use in establishing contextual relationships within the SACM information model. The following asset types are referenced or implied by the SACM use cases: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.1.1.p.1">The Asset Identification specification <a href="#NISTIR-7693">[NISTIR-7693]</a> is an XML-based data model that "provides the necessary constructs to uniquely identify assets based on known identifiers and/or known information about the assets." Asset identification plays an important role in an organization's ability to quickly correlate different sets of information about assets. The Asset Identification specification provides the necessary constructs to uniquely identify assets based on known identifiers and/or known information about the assets. Asset Identification provides a relatively flat and extensible model for capturing the identifying information about a one or more assets, and also provides a way to represent relationships between assets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.1.1.p.2">The model is organized using an inheritance hierarchy of specialized asset types/classes (see <a href="#figure-ai-class-hierarchy">Figure 8</a>), providing for extension at any level of abstraction.

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.3.p.1">A unique name for a unit of installable software. Software names should generally represent a unique release or installable version of software.  Identification approaches should allow for identification of commercially available, open source, and organizationally developed custom software. As new software releases are created, a new software identifier should be created by the releasing party (e.g., software creator, publisher, licensor). Such an identifier is useful to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relate metadata that describes the characteristics of the unit of software, potentially stored in a repository of software information. Typically, the software identifier would be used as an index into such a repository.</li>
  <li>Indicate the presence of the software unit on a given endpoint.</li>
  <li>To determine what endpoints are the targets for an assessment based on what software is installed on that endpoint.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.3.1.p.1">While we are not aware of a one-size-fits-all solution for software identification, there are two existing specifications that should be considered as part of the solution set. They are described in the following subsections.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G.3.1.3.1.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G.3.1.3.1.1">G.3.1.3.1.1.</a> Common Platform Enumeration</h1>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.3.1.1.1.p.1">The Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) <a href="#CPE-WEBSITE">[CPE-WEBSITE]</a> is composed of a family of four specification that are layered to build on lower-level functionality. The following describes each specification:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CPE Naming: A standard machine-readable format <a href="#NISTIR-7695">[NISTIR-7695]</a> for encoding names of IT products and platforms. This defines the notation used to encode the vendor, software name, edition, version and other related information for each platform or product. With the 2.3 version of CPE, a second, more advanced notation was added to the original colon-delimited notation for CPE naming.</li>
  <li>CPE Matching: A set of procedures <a href="#NISTIR-7696">[NISTIR-7696]</a> for comparing names. This describes how to compare two CPE names to one another.  It describes a logical method that ensures that automated systems comparing two CPE names would arrive at the same conclusion.</li>
  <li>CPE Applicability Language: An XML-based language <a href="#NISTIR-7698">[NISTIR-7698]</a> for constructing "applicability statements" that combine CPE names with simple logical operators.</li>
  <li>CPE Dictionary: An XML-based catalog format <a href="#NISTIR-7697">[NISTIR-7697]</a> that enumerates CPE Names and associated metadata. It details how to encode the information found in a CPE Dictionary, thereby allowing multiple organizations to maintain compatible CPE Dictionaries.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.3.1.1.1.p.2">The primary use case of CPE is for exchanging software inventory data, as it allows the usage of unique names to identify software platforms and products present on an endpoint. The NIST currently maintains and updates a dictionary of all agreed upon CPE names, and is responsible for ongoing maintenance of the standard. Many of the names in the CPE dictionary have been provided by vendors and other 3rd-parties.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.1.3.1.1.1.p.3">While the effort has seen wide adoption, most notably within the US Government, a number of critical flaws have been identified.  The most critical issues associated with the effort are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because there is no requirement for vendors to publish their own, official CPE names, CPE necessarily requires one or more organizations for curation. This centralized curation requirement ensures that the effort has difficulty scaling.</li>
  <li>Not enough primary source vendors provide platform and product naming information. As a result, this pushes too much of the effort out onto third-party groups and non-authoritative organizations. This exacerbates the ambiguity in names used for identical platforms and products and further reduces the utility of the effort.</li>

Its mention in this document is to support the historic inclusion of CPE as part of SCAP and implementation of this specification in a number of security processes and products. Going forward, software identification (SWID) tags are recommended as a replacement for CPE. To this end, work has been started to align both efforts to provide translation for software units identified using SWID tags to CPE Names. This translation would allow tools that currently use CPE-based identifiers to map to SWID identifiers during a transition period.</p>

  <li>Identify a specific unit of installable software,</li>
  <li>Enable categorization of the software (e.g., edition, bundle),</li>

SWID tags also provide for a mechanism to relate these concepts to each other. For example, installed software can be related back to the original installation media, patches can be related to the software that they patch, and software dependencies can be described for required redistributable components. SWID tags are ideally created at build-time by the software creator, publisher or licensor; are bundled with software installers; and are deployed to an endpoint during software installation.</p>

CCE provides a unique identifier for platform-specific configuration items that facilitates fast and accurate correlation of configuration items across multiple information sources and tools.

This approach to assignment requires a single organization, currently NIST, to manage allocations of CCE identifiers which doesn't scale well and introduces sustainability challenges for large volumes of identifier assignment. If this approach is used going forward by SACM, a namespaced approach is recommended for identifier assignment that allows vendors to manage their own namespace of CCE identifiers.

<p class="figure">Figure 9: The OVAL Data Model</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.1.1.2.1.p.3">The OVAL data model <a href="#OVAL-LANGUAGE">[OVAL-LANGUAGE]</a>, visualized in <a href="#figure-oval-data-model">Figure 9</a>, is composed of a number of different components. The components are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common: Constructs, enumerations, and identifier formats that are used throughout the other model components.</li>
  <li>Definitions: Constructs that describe assertions about system state. This component also includes constructs for internal variable creation and manipulation through a variety of functions. The core elements are:<ul><li>Definition: A collection of logical statements that are combined to form an assertion based on endpoint state.</li><li>Test(platform specific): A generalized construct that is extended in platform schema to describe the evaluation of expected against actual state.</li><li>Object(platform specific): A generalized construct that is extended in platform schema to describe a collectable aspect of endpoint posture.</li><li>State(platform specific): A generalized construct that is extended in platform schema to describe a set of criteria for evaluating posture attributes.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Variables: Constructs that allow for the parameterization of the elements used in the Definitions component based on externally provided values.</li>
  <li>System Characteristics: Constructs that represent collected posture from one or more endpoints. This element may be embedded with the Results component, or may be exchanged separately to allow for separate collection and evaluation. The core elements of this component are:<ul><li>CollectedObject: Provides a mapping of collected Items to elements defined in the Definitions component.</li><li>Item(platform specific): A generalized construct that is extended in platform schema to describe specific posture attributes pertaining to an aspect of endpoint state.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Results: Constructs that represent the result of evaluating expected state (state elements) against actual state (item elements). It includes the true/false evaluation result for each evaluated Definition and Test. Systems characteristics are embedded as well to provide low-level posture details.</li>
  <li>Directives: Constructs that enable result reporting detail to be declared, allowing for result production to be customized.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.1.1.2.1.p.4">End-user organizations and vendors create assessment guidance using OVAL by creating XML instances based on the XML schema implementation of the OVAL Definitions model. The OVAL Definitions model defines a structured identifier format for each of the Definition, Test, Object, State, and Item elements.  Each instantiation of these elements in OVAL XML instances are assigned a unique identifier based on the specific elements identifier syntax. These XML instances are used by tools that support OVAL to drive collection and evaluation of endpoint posture. When posture collection is performed, an OVAL Systems Characteristics XML instance is generated based on the collected posture attributes. When this collected posture is evaluated, an OVAL Result XML instance is generated that contains the results of the evaluation. In most implementations, the collection and evaluation is performed at the same time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.1.1.2.1.p.5">Many of the elements in the OVAL model (i.e., Test, Object, State, Item) are abstract, requiring a platform-specific schema implementation, called a "Component Model" in OVAL. These platform schema implementations are where platform specific posture attributes are defined. For each aspect of platform posture a specialized OVAL Object, which appears in the OVAL Definitions model, provides a format for expressing what posture attribute data to collect from an endpoint through the specification of a datatype, operation, and value(s) on entities that uniquely identify a platform configuration item. For example, a hive, key, and name is used to identify a registry key on a Windows endpoint. Each specialized OVAL Object has a corresponding specialized State, which represents the posture attributes that can be evaluated, and an Item which represents the specific posture attributes that can be collected.  Additionally, a specialized Test exists that allows collected Items corresponding to a CollectedObject to be evaluated against one or more specialized States of the same posture type.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.1.1.2.1.p.6">The OVAL language provides a generalized approach suitable for posture collection and evaluation. While this approach does provide for a degree of extensibility, there are some concerns that should be addressed in order to make OVAL a viable basis for SACM's use. These concerns include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Platform Schema Creation and Maintenance: In OVAL platform schema, the OVAL data model maintains a tight binding between the Test, Object, State, and Item elements used to assess an aspect of endpoint posture.  Creating a new platform schema or adding a new posture aspect to an existing platform schema can be a very labor intensive process. Doing so often involves researching and understanding system APIs and can be prone to issues with inconsistency within and between platforms. To simplify platform schema creation and maintenance, the model needs to be evolved to generalize the Test, Object, and State elements, requiring only the definition of an Item representation.</li>
  <li>Given an XML instance based on the Definitions model, it is not clear in the specification how incremental collection and evaluation can occur. Because of this, typically, OVAL assessments are performed on a periodic basis. The OVAL specification needs to be enhanced to include specifications for performing event-based and incremental assessment in addition to full periodic collection.</li>
  <li>Defining new functions for manipulating variable values is current handled in the Definitions schema. This requires revision to the core language to add new functions. The OVAL specification needs to be evolved to provide for greater extensibility in this area, allowing extension schema to define new functions.</li>
  <li>The current process for releasing a new version of OVAL, bundle releases of the core language with release of community recognized platform schema. The revision processes for the core and platform schema need to be decoupled. Each platform schema should use some mechanism to declare which core language version it relies on.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.1.1.2.1.p.7">If adopted by SCAM, these issues will need to be addressed as part of the SCAM engineering work to make OVAL more broadly adoptable as a general purpose data model for posture collection and evaluation.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.1.1.2.2.p.1">Each OVAL Object is identified by a globally unique identifier.  This globally unique identifier could be used by the SACM community to identify platform-specific configuration items and at the same time serve as collection guidance. If used in this manner, OVAL Objects would likely need to undergo changes in order to decouple it from evaluation guidance and to provide more robust collection capabilities to support the needs of the SACM community.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.G.3.2.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.G.3.2.2">G.3.2.2.</a> Configuration Item Identifier</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.2.p.1">An identifier for a high-level, platform-independent configuration control.  This identification concept is necessary to allow similar configuration item concepts to be comparable across platforms. For example, a configuration item might be created for the minimum password length configuration control, which may then have a number of different platform-specific configuration settings. Without this type of identification, it will be difficult to perform evaluation of expected versus actual state in a platform-neutral way.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.2.p.2">High-level configuration items tend to change much less frequently than the platform-specific configuration items (see <a href="#IM-ELEMENTS-OTHER-IDENTIFIERS-PLATFORM-CI">Appendix G.3.2.1</a>) that might be associated with them. To provide for the greatest amount of sustainability, collections of configuration item identifiers are best defined by specific communities of interest, while platform-specific identifiers are best defined by the source vendor of the platform. Under this model, the primary source vendors would map their platform-specific configuration controls to the appropriate platform-independent item allowing end-user organizations to make use of these relationships.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.2.p.3">To support different communities of interest, it may be necessary to support multiple methods for identification of configuration items and for associating related metadata. Use of an IANA registry supporting multiple configuration item identification methods would be an ideal way forward. To the extent possible, a few number of configuration item identification approaches is desirable, to maximize the update by vendors who would be maintain mapping of platform-specific configuration identifiers to the more general platform-neutral configuration identifiers.</p>

According to their website, CCI "provides a standard identifier and description for each of the singular, actionable statements that comprise an information assurance (IA) control or IA best practice. CCI bridges the gap between high-level policy expressions and low-level technical implementations. CCI allows a security requirement that is expressed in a high-level policy framework to be decomposed and explicitly associated with the low-level security setting(s) that must be assessed to determine compliance with the objectives of that specific security control. This ability to trace security requirements from their origin (e.g., regulations, IA frameworks) to their low-level implementation allows organizations to readily demonstrate compliance to multiple IA compliance frameworks. CCI also provides a means to objectively roll-up and compare related compliance assessment results across disparate technologies."</p>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.2.1.2.p.1">There will likely be a desire by different communities to create different collections of configuration item identifiers. This fracturing may be caused by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different requirements for levels of abstraction,</li>
  <li>Varying needs for timely maintenance of the collection, and</li>
  <li>Differing scopes of technological needs.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.2.2.1.2.p.2">Due to these and other potential needs, it will be difficult to standardize around a single collection of configuration identifiers.  A workable solution will be one that is scalable and usable for a broad population of end-user organizations. An alternate approach that should be considered is the definition of data model that contains a common set of metadata attributes, perhaps supported by an extensible taxonomy, that can be assigned to platform-specific configuration items. If defined at a necessary level of granularity, it may be possible to query collections of platform-specific configuration items provided by vendors to create groupings at various levels of abstractions. By utilizing data provided by vendors, technological needs and the timeliness of information can be addressed based on customer requirements.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.3.1.2.2.p.1">For Endpoint Characterization, ARF can be used in multiple ways due to its flexibility.

<p id="rfc.section.G.3.6.1.1.2.p.1">A general description of XCCDF was provided in <a href="#XCCDF-BACKGROUND">Appendix G.3.3.1.1.1</a>. As noted there, an XCCDF document represents a checklist of items against which a given endpoint's state is compared and evaluated. An XCCDF Rule represents one assessed item in this checklist. A Rule contains both a prose description of the assessed item (either for presentation to the user in a tool's user interface, or for rendering into a prose checklist for human consumption) and can also contain instructions to support automated evaluation of the assessed item, if such automated assessment is possible. Automated assessment instructions can be provided either within the XCCDF Rule itself, or by providing a reference to instructions expressed in other languages, such as OVAL.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.6.1.1.2.p.2">In order to support greater flexibility in XCCDF, checklists can be tailored to meet certain needs. One way to do this is to enable or disable certain rules that are appropriate or inappropriate to a given endpoint, respectively. For example, a single XCCDF checklist might contain check items to evaluate the configuration of an endpoint's operating system. An endpoint deployed in an enterprise's DMZ might need to be locked down more than a common internal endpoint, due to the greater exposure to attack. In this case, some operating system configuration requirements for the DMZ endpoint might be unnecessary for the internal endpoint. Nonetheless, most configuration requirements would probably remain applicable to both environments (providing a common baseline for configuration of the given operating system) and thus be common to the checking instructions for both types of endpoints. XCCDF supports this by allowing a single checklist to be defined, but then tailored to the needs of the assessed endpoint. In the previous example, some Rules that apply only to the DMZ endpoint would be disabled during the assessment of an internal endpoint and would not be exercised during the assessment or count towards the assessment results. To accomplish this, XCCDF uses the CPE Applicability Language. By enhancing this applicability language to support other aspects of endpoint characterization (see <a href="#CPE-APPLICABILITY-BACKGROUND">Appendix G.3.3.1.3</a>), XCCDF will also benefit from these enhancements.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.G.3.6.1.1.2.p.3">In addition, XCCDF Rules also support parameterization, allowing customization of the expected value for a given check item. For example, the DMZ endpoint might require a password of at least 12 characters, while an internal endpoint may only need 8 or more characters in its password. By employing parameterization of the XCCDF Rule, the same Rule can be used when assessing either type of endpoint, and simply be provided with a different target parameter each time to reflect the different role-based requirements. Sets of customizations can be stored within the XCCDF document itself: XCCDF Values store parameters values that can be used in tailoring, while XCCDF Profiles store sets of tailoring instructions, including selection of certain Values as parameters and the enabling and disabling of certain Rules. The tailoring capabilities supported by XCCDF allow a single XCCDF document to encapsulate configuration evaluation guidance that applies to a broad range of endpoint roles.</p>

For example, an XCCDF Rule result might indicate that an endpoint failed to pass requirement that passwords be of a length greater than or equal to 8, but it would not capture that the endpoint was, in fact, only requiring passwords of 4 or more characters. It may, however, be possible for a user to discover this information via other means.

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H">Appendix H.</a> Graph Model</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.1">TODO: Write text on how the information model above can be realized in this kind of graph model.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.2">The graph model describes how security information is structured, related, and accessed. Control of operations to supply and/or access the data is architecturally distinct from the structuring of the data in the information model.  Authorization may be applied by the Control Plane (as defined in the SACM Architecture <a href="#I-D.ietf-sacm-architecture">[I-D.ietf-sacm-architecture]</a>) to requests for information from a consumer or requests for publication from a provider, and may also be applied by a provider to a direct request from a consumer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.3">This architecture addresses information structure independently of the access/transport of that information. This separation enables scalability, customizability, and extensibility.  Access to provide or consume information is particularly suited to publish/subscribe/query data transport and data access control models.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.p.4">This graph model is a framework that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facilitates the definition of extensible data types that support SACM's use cases</li>
  <li>Provides a structure for the defined data types to be exchanged via a variety of data transport models</li>
  <li>Describes components used in information exchange, and the objects exchanged</li>
  <li>Captures and organizes evolving information and information relationships for multiple data publishers</li>
  <li>Provides access to the published information via publish, query, and subscribe operations</li>
  <li>Leverages the knowledge and experience gained from incorporating TNC IF-MAP into many disparate products that have to integrate and share an information model in a scalable, extensible manner</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.1">H.1.</a> Background: Graph Models</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.1.p.1">Knowledge is often represented with graph-based formalisms. A common formalism defines a graph as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A set of *vertices*</li>
  <li>A set of *edges*, each connecting two vertices (technically, an edge is an ordered pair of vertices)</li>
  <li>A set of zero or more *properties* attached to each vertices and edges. Each property consists of a type and a optionally a value.  The type and the value are typically just strings</li>
</ul>

<p id="rfc.section.H.1.p.2">A pair of vertices connected by an edge is commonly referred to as a triple that comprises subject, predicate and object. For example, subject = Sue Wong, predicate = is-parent-of, object = Ann Wong.

<p id="rfc.section.H.2.p.3">In this mode, identifiers and metadata have hierarchical structure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.2.p.4">The graphical aspect makes this model well suited to non-hierarchical relationships, such as connectivity in a computer network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.2.p.5">Hierarchical properties allow this model to accommodate structures such as YANG <a href="#RFC6020">[RFC6020]</a> data models.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.3"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.3">H.3.</a> Identifiers</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.1">Each identifier is an XML element. For extensibility, schemas use xsd:anyAttribute and such. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.2">Alternately, this model could be changed to use another hierarchical notation, such as JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.3">Identifiers are unique: two different vertices cannot have equivalent identifiers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.4">An identifier has a type. There is a finite, but extensible, set of identifier types. If the identifier is XML, the type is based on the XML schema.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.5">In IF-MAP, standard identifier types include IP address, MAC address, identity, and overlay network. Additional identifier types will need to be standardized for SACM use cases.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.6">Any number of metadata items can be attached to an identifier.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.3.p.7">Some identifiers, especially those relating to identity, address, and location, require the ability to specify an administrative domain (such as AD domain, L2 broadcast domain / L3 routing domain, or geographic domain) in order to differentiate between instances with the same name occurring in different realms.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.4"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.4">H.4.</a> Links</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.4.p.1">A link can be thought of as an ordered pair of identifiers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.4.p.2">Any number of metadata items can be attached to a link.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.5"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.5">H.5.</a> Metadata</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.5.p.1">A metadata item is the basic unit of information, and is attached to an identifier or to a link.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.5.p.2">A given metadata item is an XML document. In IF-MAP metadata items are generally small. However, larger ones, such as YANG data models, can also fit. For extensibility, the XML schemas of metadata items use xsd:anyAttribute and such.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.5.p.3">Alternately, this model could be changed to use another hierarchical notation, such as JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.5.p.4">A metadata item has a type. There is a finite, but extensible, set of metadata types. If the metadata item is XML, the type is based on the XML schema. An example metadata type is http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/2010/IFMAP-METADATA/2#device- characteristic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.5.p.5">TNC IF-MAP Metadata for Network Security <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA]</a> and TNC IF-MAP Metadata for ICS Security <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA]</a> define many pertinent metadata types. More will need to be standardized for SACM use cases.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.6"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.6">H.6.</a> Use for SACM</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.6.p.1">Many of the information elements can be represented as vertices, and many of the relationships can be represented as edges.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.6.p.2">Identifiers are like database keys. For example, there would be identifiers for addresses, identities, unique endpoint identifiers, software component identifiers, and hardware component identifiers. The inventory of software instances and hardware instances within an endpoint might be expressed using a single YANG description, as a single metadata item in the graph. Where to put Endpoint Attribute Assertions, Evaluation Results, and the like is an open question.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.7"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.7">H.7.</a> <a href="#sec-im-tnc-graph-provenance" id="sec-im-tnc-graph-provenance">Provenance</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.7.p.1">Provenance helps to protect the SACM ecosystem against a misled or malicious provider.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.7.p.2">The provenance of a metadata item includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The time when the item was produced</li>
  <li>The component that produced the item, including its software and version</li>
  <li>The policies that governed the producing component, with versions</li>
  <li>The method used to produce the information (e.g., vulnerability scan)</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.H.7.p.3">How provenance should be expressed is an open question. For reference, in IF-MAP provenance of a metadata item is expressed within the metadata item <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA]</a>. For example, there is a top-level XML attribute called "timestamp".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.7.p.4">It is critical that provenance be secure from tampering. How to achieve that security is out of scope of this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.H.8"><a href="#rfc.appendix.H.8">H.8.</a> Extensibility</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.H.8.p.1">Anyone can define an identifier type or a metadata type, by creating an XML schema (or other specification). There is no need for a central authority.  Some deployments may exercise administrative control over the permitted identifier types and metadata types; others may leave components free rein.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.8.p.2">A community of components can agree on and use new identifier and metadata types, if the administrators allow it. This allows rapid innovation.  Intermediate software that conveys graph changes from one component to another does not need changes. Components that do not understand the new types do not need changes. Accordingly, a consumer normally ignores metadata types and identifier types it does not understand.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.H.8.p.3">As a proof point for this agility, the original use cases for TNC IF- MAP Binding for SOAP <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding">[TNC-IF-MAP-SOAP-Binding]</a> were addressed in TNC IF-MAP Metadata for Network Security <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-NETSEC-METADATA]</a>. Some years later an additional, major set of use cases, TNC IF-MAP Metadata for ICS <a href="#TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA">[TNC-IF-MAP-ICS-METADATA]</a>, were specified and implemented.</p>
